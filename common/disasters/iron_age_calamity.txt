	# How the Disaster Works:
	# After the asteroid hits the Orbury Supervolcano and the effects are felt a year later,
	# this disaster gets enabled for everyone
	# High Stability + High Legitimacy allows you to stay out of the disaster. Depending on where you are, and
	# how big you are, the effects become less/more severe
	#
	# Legitimacy is used as a proxy for your country's integrity. You get 50 legitimacy at the start of the disaster.
	# Excess legitimacy is turned into monarch power (like the prestige effect)
	# 
	# High legitimacy during the disaster will enable certain actions that will grant a bonus but decrease legitimacy
	#
	# If you have low legitimacy, you can take certain actions to increase legitimacy, but at a long term cost
	#	these modifiers & effects get applied after the disaster is over
	#
	# Stability also acts in a similar fashion. Hitting -3 stability will reduce your legitimacy & increase your stab.
	#
	# If you are at -3 stab & has low legitimacy, then you will get the collapse disaster where your country will start
	# breaking apart
	#
	# Old version had disaster severity by country. Instead, it's going to be by province. Severely effected provinces will 
	# lower legitimacy, increase stab cost, increase local unrest, dev cost, and reduce local tax, manpower, and goods produced
	# Moderately affected will have less severe modifiers. Mild will not have any legitimacy modifier.
	#
	# In order to get out of the Calamity, you must pass a series of reforms in addition to having high stab and not low legitimacy.
