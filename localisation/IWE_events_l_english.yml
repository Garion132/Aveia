 iwenlumy.1.t:0 "A Most Rowdy Duchy"
 iwenlumy.1.d:0 "Recently, rumors have been spreading about how our most powerful duchy, Iwenlumy, guardian of Asemont, is seeking independence. Whilst such rumors would normally be laughable, dismissed as commoner rabble, these rumors are indeed being confirmed by some of the most powerful merchants in the Cradle. Thus, we ought to take them seriously, for losing Iwenlumy would cripple our kingdom and our prestige.\n\nThe old city of Nennli in the borderlands between the old heart of Kyath and Iwenlumy has long been a site of contention between the two crowns. It has been under the management of Iwenlumy since the compromise under Aldarri the Peaceable who managed some hundred years ago to keep Iwenlumy as a vassal state in the infancy of Kyathi rule. We could claim it, though killing the agreement may upset our other vassals as well, and will certainly upset Iwenlumy.\n\nAlternatively, we could call it out for what it is, high treason, and threaten anyone in the duchy with death by hanging, though that may not transpire well as there is no solid evidence nor suspects.\n\nLastly, we could just make vague threats towards the nobility in the duchy."

 iwenlumy.2.t:0 "Kyath Siezes Nennli!"
 iwenlumy.2.d:0 "The ruler of Kyath has, for some arbitrary reason, broken the hundred year long compromise between King Aldarri the Peaceable and Duchess Cellia and is now demanding that we hand over the city of Nennli. The only way we refuse this outrageous demand is if we declare independence, though the other duchies may be inspired by our actions. Though it may be suicide."
 iwenlumy.2.a:0 "Give it up"

 iwenlumy.3.t:0 "Our Liege Demands we Cease our Treason!"
 iwenlumy.3.d:0 "The King of Kyath has demanded that we forfeit our search for independence. How he has learened of our plans we do not know. We have no option to dismiss the accusation, so we are left with two options. We can give up, or we can attempt to fight back. If we fight, then the other duchies may be inspired by our actions, though it may be suicide."
 iwenlumy.3.a:0 "Fine!"
 iwenlumy.3.a.tt:0 "We will no longer be able to complete our 'Independence' missions."

 iwenlumy.4.t:0 "Our Liege Threatens our Nobles."
 iwenlumy.4.d:0 "The King of Kyath has made vague threats against some of our nobles to keep in line. Some have been scared to compliance, but most have dismissed his pretentions. Otherwise, it's slightly embarrasing."
 iwenlumy.4.a:0 "Whatever"

 iwenlumy.5.t:0 "Colonial Ventures"
 iwenlumy.5.d:0 "The Scramble for Elteria has begun for the prized Ecriamin on the continent. Thus, many of our advisors have begged us to consider establishing colonies on the continent. Some have proposed we go for the relatively untouched Palentei Bay that we have easy access to. Others have proposed that we sail around the continent to establish a colony on the far side of the continent."
 iwenlumy.5.a:0 "Outfit an Expedition to the Palentei Bay"

 iwenlumy.5.c:0 "Why limit ourselves? Every option and more!"
 iwenlumy.5.e:0 "Maybe this is a bit much..."
