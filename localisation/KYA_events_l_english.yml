 kyath.1.t:0 "Settling into the New Capital"
 kyath.1.d:0 "On the orders of Charles VI of the Kingdom of Kyath, the royal court has been moved from the city of Kyatha on lake Oleml to the port city of Oruinyal. This move has upset many and has not gone over well with many of the old guard. While the Royal Family has been convinced of moving to the more prosperous and accessible Oruinyal, many others have not. As such, much work will be needed to convince them that such a move was worthy of the effort."
 kyath.1.op1:0 "We must re-establish ourselves"

 kyath.2.t:0 "Establishing Control"
 kyath.2.d:0 "The fervent divide in our court has revealed the weaknesses of the governing style of the Kyathian Council. While it was established to stabilize the Kingdom, it has lead, in more recent times, to hot-headed debates and deadlock. If even on minor issues like moving the capital to a more advantageous position the council is bitterly divided then obviously it is a weight upon the Kingdom of Kyath and not a benefit. Not to mention that it has lead to the deteroration of the authority of the Monarch. It must be reformed to allow the Crown space to manuever independent of the council.\n\nOne of the biggest obstructionists is §RIwenlumy§! who has been a problem state for a while. They hold extensive autonomy yet constantly bicker for more. The other dukes are not much better, but are, in comparison, utterly orderly and loyal compared to Iwenlumy. There are also other §Rminor nobles§! and the §Rclergy§! to be worried about. The traders and merchants are not very influential so can be disregarded fairly easily.\n\nIn order to achieve reform, you must enact several §Gdecisions§! and take certain sides in §Gevents§! to centralize power within the Crown. Be wary, going too fast may lead to our vassals and estates demanding concessions (if their §RLiberty Desire§! exceeds §R50%§! or §RLoyalty§! below §R20%§! respectively) or even result in the §Rbreakup of Kyath if LD goes above 75%!§! Failure to reform may also be catastrophic when a §Rfuture crisis emerges.§!"

 kyath.50.t:0 "Iwenlumy Reminds us of the Contract of Nalean"
 kyath.50.d:0 "It appears that the Duchy of Iwenlumy has sought fit to petition the King about renewing our promises made for the Contract of Nalean.\n\nThe Contract of Nalean was signed on the Fifth Day of Summer, 1160 for a time of two hundred years. It gave extensive protections and autonomy to the Greater Dukes of Kyath. Each of the Greater Dukes would be entitled to the commitments and taxes of their locals while Kyath offered protection from the larger states to the East and West. The arrangement has allowed the Kingdom of Kyath to punch far above its weight in fielded manpower and overall taxes collected but has lead to a weak central monarch who is often more at odds with the Greater Dukes, the Nobility, and the Clergy than any state outside of Kyath.\n\nIt is in this state that Iwenlumy has been constantly pestering for greater autonomy nearly to the point of treason. As such, they attempt to use the Contract as a way to further their goals, however, previous rulers have managed to erode the Contract with Iwenlumy. Now they seek to restore their old rights to which we can either commit to it, which will likely keep them happy, or refuse to bow to their demands."
 kyath.50.op1:0 "Yes, we are bound to the terms"
 kyath.50.op2:0 "Just make vague promises to uphold the treaty"

 kyath.100.t:0 "A City of Gods and Marble"
 kyath.100.d:0 "Through much effort, tears, and sweat, the former Iwen capital has been renovated. A city dorned with marble engraved by the finest craftsmen. The shrines and temples within the religious destrict shine with impeccable beauty and are surrounded with great vegetation worthy of only the gods themselves.\n\nAs thus, we have declared this city, so clearly protected by the Gods themselves, as, not only the center of civilization, but the birthplace of the wonders of advanced life. Some intellectuals question why such rennovations were necessary, but most appear to accept such a proposition. \n\nIwenlumy, already a necessary stop for pilgramages across Aveia, has only become more popular. Our Kingdom is now more respected at home and abroad, and many religious scholars respect our dedication to the Gods."
