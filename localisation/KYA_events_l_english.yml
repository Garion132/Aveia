 kyath.1.t:0 "Settling into the New Capital"
 kyath.1.d:0 "On the orders of Charles VI of the Kingdom of Kyath, the royal court has been moved from the city of Kyatha on lake Oleml to the port city of Oruinyal. This move has upset many and has not gone over well with many of the old guard. While the Royal Family has been convinced of moving to the more prosperous and accessible Oruinyal, many others have not. As such, much work will be needed to convince them that such a move was worthy of the effort."

 kyath.100.t:0 "A City of Gods and Marble"
 kyath.100.d:0 "Through much effort, tears, and sweat, the former Iwen capital has been renovated. A city dorned with marble engraved by the finest craftsmen. The shrines and temples within the religious destrict shine with impeccable beauty and are surrounded with great vegetation worthy of only the gods themselves.\n\nAs thus, we have declared this city, so clearly protected by the Gods themselves, as, not only the center of civilization, but the birthplace of the wonders of advanced life. Some intellectuals question why such rennovations were necessary, but most appear to accept such a proposition. \n\nIwenlumy, already a necessary stop for pilgramages across Aveia, has only become more popular. Our Kingdom is now more respected at home and abroad, and many religious scholars respect our dedication to the Gods."
