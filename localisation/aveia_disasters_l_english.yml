However, much of the situation could be alleviated by taking much of the nobility's land used for pleasure and hunting and instead using it as farmland. Much of our most fertile land rests within these pleasure-providers.\n\nWe can also lessen trade restrictions and try to import food from where there is some amount of excess, yet this is a temporary solution as others kingdoms will do the same and dilute the global food supply. Siezing land will greatly upset the nobility, yet it may prove to be the only way to permanently stop this downward spiral."
