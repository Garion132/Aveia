  iac_allow_commoners_to_become_clerks_title:0 "Administration: Commoners into Clerks"
  iac_allow_commoners_to_become_clerks_desc:0 "During the history of our rule, nearly all clerks have originated within the clergy. Opening our doors to commoners who can read ought to solve the manpower problems within the administration. The Clergy views this with a certain weariness but some are open to the idea given the circumstances."
  iac_allow_commoners_to_become_clerks_tt:0 "Reduces §YGoverning Cost§! and §YExpand Administration Cost§!\nMay cost §Rstability§! and provoke a §Rrevolt!§!\n"
  iac_bureaucratic_privilege_title:0 "Administration: Enact Bureaucratic Privilege"
  iac_bureaucratic_privilege_desc:0 "By granting our bureaucrats flexibility and various emergency powers, we can ease the strain on the administration caused by the calamity."
  iac_bureaucratic_privilege_tt:0 "Removes §YStarved Administration§!\n"
  iac_simplify_the_legal_code_title:0 "Administration: Reform the Legal Code"
  iac_simplify_the_legal_code_desc:0 "Over the years, the legal code has become a jumbled mess that only the clergy could interpret. Reforming the code will ease strains and provide meaningful justice in our realm."
  iac_simplify_the_legal_code_tt:0 "Reduces §YStability Cost§! and §YGlobal Unrest§!, Grants §YGovernment Reform Progress§!"
  iac_simplify_the_tax_code_title:0 "Administration: Simplify the Tax Code"
  iac_simplify_the_tax_code_desc:0 "Previously, attempts were made to make the tax code as efficient as possible in collecting as much taxes as possible. This made the tax code decently complicated but it was effective in tax collection. Now, its complexity is its biggest flaw. Simplifying the tax code will not only make collecting taxes easier, it will also increase revenues as it is easier to enforce."
  iac_abolish_tax_exemptions_title:0 "Administration: Abolish Tax Exemptions"
  iac_abolish_tax_exemptions_desc:0 "Many estates and powerful actors in our realm have tax exemptions granted in the past as privileges. Now that we are in much more difficult times, we need to remove those exemptions to bolster the treasury."
  iac_decentralize_power_title:0 "Administration: Decentralize Power"
  iac_decentralize_power_desc:0 "The centralized administration in the capital has proven to be too inflexible to deal with the crises that we have had to deal with during the calamity. In order to adjust for the future, we will need to decentralize power so that the rulers of the future can govern over a much more stable and flexible realm."
  iac_secularize_the_bureaucracy_title:0 "Administration: Secularize the Bureaucracy"
  iac_secularize_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The administration has generally always been aided by the clergy. Scribes and clerks both all originated from the clergy, but the limited amount of clergy combined with the excessive powers that they used (and abused) prior to the calamity proves that the need for a more secular style of government is needed. Not one completely separate from religion, but rather simply allowing much of the accounting and bureaucracy to be fulfilled by members outside the clergy. This final act of reform will finally fix our administrative problems, some of which we didn't even know we had prior to the calamity."

  iac_clamp_down_on_desertion_title:0 "Military: Clamp Down on Desertion"
  iac_clamp_down_on_desertion_desc:0 "With the start of massive crises, many soldiers are deserting our ranks due to inconsistencies in pay and care. We must ensure that our military is fed and that deserters are properly found and executed."
  iac_martial_law_title:0 "Military: Declare Martial Law"
  iac_martial_law_desc:0 "Martial Law involves the state military having absolute authority to enforce order throughout our land. Typically, city guards would ensure stability, but in these trying times they are becoming succeptible to corruption and desertion. The military, thus, are the only ones able to properly enforce the law as descrobed."

However, never was there a truly serious discussion about it until now when the state is struggling to stay afloat.\n\nThe idea is that making more people eligible to become clerks, we can ease the bureaucratic strain on our state.

  iron_age_calamity.252.d:0 "With the Clergy's concerns mostly addressed, we must move on to actually funding this venture. There are multiple avenues to provide funding. One is to provide a short cash-infusion which will drain the coffers quickly but put the reform on an accelerated time-frame. Another is to provide funding over an entire year, thus spreading out the costs and likely resulting in a slightly more efficient spending program. The last option would be to skim resources off of other areas of the government to make room, though this will likely impede efforts to stabilize the country elsewhere. We can also try and secretly get money for the project, or just try and run a reduced program, though that might cause issues in the long run."

  iron_age_calamity.255.d:0 "Prior to the crisis, our bureaucrats had no issues with carrying out the duties of the state. Nowadays, they are struggling to even maintain the most basic of governmental functions. One easy reform to pursue would be to provide them with the powers necessary to overrule others and circumvent normal processes to more effectively manage the state. Such a reform would be generally unpopular, but seen as necessary, so not many should complain about it."

If this is to be rectified, they must be given additional powers to supplement the ones they currently have. It would make their jobs easier and make the functions of state perform better. The question is to what degree. Granting unlimited powers might solve any immediate issues, but could leave room for abuse that could easily cascade later, though we may have little choice. On the other hand, providing few additional powers would not do anything."

  iron_age_calamity.259.d:0 "The legal code of our current state is a mess and simply cannot handle the current affairs of society. It varies from province to province, city to city, and even person to person. A series of reforms could re-establish a semblance of stability and trust in governance that is desperately needed in these times. Not to mention easing pressures on the state and catching evil-doers."

Most punishments are currently summary executions, but crueler punishments like beatings and amputation for minor crimes could help discourage those crimes as the perpetrator must live with the punishment. To allieviate the state, we could temporarily suspend punishment for petty crimes, though would result in a crime wave."

  iron_age_calamity.262.d:0 "As of current, individuals are held to account by the City Guardsmen or whomever may be responsible for upholding the rule of law in a city or area. The official then will make his own judgement on whether or not the individual is guilty or not. This has led to corruption and improper procedures. Instead, certain individuals have advocated for a trial system, where a trail is held against the defendant where the defendant is allowed to argue his case infront of a jury of his peers and the law official must argue a case against the defendant and convince a majority of the jury that the defendant is guilty. Such a system would be much more difficult to corrupt and would likely lead to a fairer society, but may end up complicating catching and prosecuting criminals."

We could establish a dedicated force for catching criminals given how rampant they are in these times. However the expense of pursuing this might be well beyond what is reasonable."
