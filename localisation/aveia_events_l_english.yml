 prices.100.d:0 "A great darkness filled the sky. Clouds of gods-know-what roamed over our vast fields and choked them of sunlight. Now our harvests yield nothing.\nFamine is rampant in a land once of plenty. The populace is starving. Peasants keep what they can grow. Troops cannot be fed. Even nobles find it difficult to find food. Rats and mice are found cannibalizing each other.\nTemperatures have dropped and, in parts of our land where no snow has touched, blizzards breach once-warm towns and villages. In the great city of Lindoremy, shells of once proud elven beings wander the streets, lie down, and freeze and die in place."
 prices.100.a:0 "It will be a long... long... winter."
