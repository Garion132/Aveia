 iron_age_calamity.1.d:0 "Every now and again, a peasant makes an observation of the night sky and spots a streak of light moving across the sky. They follow up by spreading rumors and causing a ruckus across the country. However, the most recent sighting hasn't dissappeared unlike previous sightings. INstead, the perturbation in the sky has grown larger and brighter than any other of the stars that dot the sky.\nRumors have spread that this is the end times. Our spiritual and political leaders have tried their best to dispell these rumors and ensure calm. However, some of them are starting to believe in the end times themselves."

 prices.100.d:0 "A great darkness filled the sky. Clouds of gods-know-what roamed over our vast fields and choked them of sunlight. Now our harvests yield nothing.\nFamine is rampant in a land once of plenty. The populace is starving. Peasants keep what they can grow. Troops cannot be fed. Even nobles find it difficult to find food. Rats and mice are found cannibalizing each other.\nTemperatures have dropped and, in parts of our land where no snow has touched, blizzards breach once-warm towns and villages. In the great city of Lindoremy, shells of once proud elven beings wander the streets, lie down, and freeze and die in place."
