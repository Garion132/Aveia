 prices.100.t:0 "Raining Ash"
 prices.100.d:0 "A great darkness filled the sky. Clouds of gods-know-what roamed over our vast fields and choked them of sunlight. Now our harvests yield nothing.\nFamine is rampant in a land once of plenty. The populace is starving. Peasants keep what they can grow. Troops cannot be fed. Even nobles find it difficult to find food. Rats and mice are found cannibalizing each other.\nTemperatures have dropped and, in parts of our land where no snow has touched, blizzards breach once-warm towns and villages. In the great city of Lindoremy, shells of once proud elven beings wander the streets, lie down, and freeze and die in place."

 prices.101.t:0 "Herbalist Shops"
 prices.101.d:0 "An old plant discovered in the continent of Elteria now has new uses. Recent discoveries have revealed that the many small clovers found in Elteria called 'ecriamin' have many herbal qualities that, when applied, can heal wounds, when consumed, can soothe throats and coughs and, when eaten, appears to restore strength to a mortally ill person.\n\nThus, Herbalist Shops have sprung up all around our country as merchants scramble to grab this new magical plant that can cure ailments and save lives. Pioneers go out to seek areas which are most ideal for these plants. Many even attempt to try to grow the plant in Aveia itself, without much success. Some have described it as 'Clover-Mania.'\n\nThe new herbalist shops provide more convinient locations to buy other plants as well. The little-known 'sunspot' which produces light when crushed, the well-known gold knot, and other herbs and spices are sold through these establishments."
 prices.101.a:0 "Perhaps I could use some."
 prices.102.t:0 "End of the Bronze Age"
 prices.102.d:0 "The Iron Age Calamity has resulted in most armies abandoning their risky and expensive trade routes for copper to turn into bronze and instead swapping over to the inferior but much cheaper and more accessible iron. Thus, prices for copper and tin have both dropped. Additionally, with better and more efficient kilns and workshops, ceramics, a staple of urban Bronze-Age economies, has become cheaper to make."

If we stop our grain export, we can help our own population, though handicap our income. If we continue, we can continue to make a lot of money, though risking further instability."

While experimenting with different metal transmutations, he stumbled upon a way to transmutate Tin into Silver! He has tried to keep the secret squirreled away, but word has gotten out and now everyone is attempting at creating silver from tin."

 prices.119.t:0 "Impurities in Transmutations"
 prices.119.d:0 "During the height of the tin to silver transmutation craze, a skeptical alchemist by the name of Naler Taketal has found distinct impurities in the silver produced by tin. These impurities are easily distinguishable from anything else and can even be observed by the common person. This, coinciding with more recent skepticism of transmutations, has led to the outright rejection of impure coins minted by would-be alchemists. Experienced alchemists can still transmutate tin into silver with few impurities, not noticable to the naked eye, but given the rarity of such people, they have a negligible impact."

 elteria_event.18.d:0 "Saltera, a once lesser-known explorer, has done the impossible. On a journey lasting two months, he journeyed around the Elterian continent. He started from the Eihelilaurt Docks and sailed west. He last took supplies from the port at Villou, setting off south along the wilderness of Elteria, charting the coasts and oceans. He has documented many strange animals and vegetation on the westwrad side, in particular an animal which has three legs down towards what he noted as Felton.\n\nHe finished his voyage in Sraneas, bringing his charts and journal back to civilization to spread the word about the nature of the continent. His charts have sparked controversy, especially among the more optimistic of colonialists, that the continent appears vapidly thin on his maps. However, he is the first to document the western half."

They have returned with tales and tracks of the interior. Apparently, the Fauns have established a few petty Kingdoms in the interior. However, without access to copper and tin, the Fauns have no chance of combatting any Elven Phalanx or Dwarven unit on an honest battlefield. \n\nRegardless, the expedition has mapped the interior, allowing the colonial powers of Aveia to fully grasp the riches of Elteria."
