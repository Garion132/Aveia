 prices.100.d:0 "A great darkness filled the sky. Clouds of gods-know-what roamed over our vast fields and choked them of sunlight. Now our harvests yield nothing.\nFamine is rampant in a land once of plenty. The populace is starving. Peasants keep what they can grow. Troops cannot be fed. Even nobles find it difficult to find food. Rats and mice are found cannibalizing each other.\nTemperatures have dropped and, in parts of our land where no snow has touched, blizzards breach once-warm towns and villages. In the great city of Lindoremy, shells of once proud elven beings wander the streets, lie down, and freeze and die in place."

 prices.101.d:0 "An old plant discovered in the continent of Elteria now has new uses. Recent discoveries have revealed that the many small clovers found in Elteria called 'ecriamin' have many herbal qualities that, when applied, can heal wounds, when consumed, can soothe throats and coughs and, when eaten, appears to restore strength to a mortally ill person.\n\nThus, Herbalist Shops have sprung up all around our country as merchants scramble to grab this new magical plant that can cure ailments and save lives. Pioneers go out to seek areas which are most ideal for these plants. Many even attempt to try to grow the plant in Aveia itself, without much success. Some have described it as 'Clover-Mania.'\n\nThe new herbalist shops provide more convinient locations to buy other plants as well. The little-known 'sunspot' which produces light when crushed, the well-known gold knot, and other herbs and spices are sold through these establishments."

 prices.102.d:0 "The Iron Age Calamity has resulted in most armies abandoning their risky and expensive trade routes for copper to turn into bronze and instead swapping over to the inferior but much cheaper and more accessible iron. Thus, prices for copper and tin have both dropped. Additionally, with better and more efficient kilns and workshops, ceramics, a staple of urban Bronze-Age economies, has become cheaper to make."
