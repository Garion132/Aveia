 advisor_flavor.1.t: "The Arrival of Barusard Caluri"
 advisor_flavor.1.d: "Coming from a small village outside of Tiierlot, Barusard spent most of his early life moving between the ever feuding city states of the Krashyrvil Midlands. A smith by trade, Barusard discovered the secret of bronze without temple guidance. While this has put him in opposition to the local temples, his hard-found knowledge and unique insights into bronze making have leveraged him into an invaluable asset to many small groups that cannot afford to the temple's commissionment of bronze tools.\n\nIncentivized to now leverage his skills, Barusard has now approached our preminant state with an innovative idea for bronze smelting... it just requires our funding."
