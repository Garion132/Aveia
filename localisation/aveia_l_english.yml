 squirrel_shortbowscurDESCR:0 "With the Scurians shorter sizes and somewhat weaker arm strengths, it's no surprise that the shortbow became a widely used hunting tool for Scurians.

 squirrel_longbowscur:0 "(8) Longbowscur"

Samaraptors take a while to start up and their machinery, due to mostly being wooden, is prone to excessive degradation and need to be replaced regularly. In order to deploy Scurians at a short range, they've been equipped with new gliders, using Samara seeds as gliding material."

 squirrel_steelwood_riflescurDESCR:0 "One of the biggest issues we've faced with our new rifles is that, due to the smaller size of our soldiers, our rifles' barrels have to be generally thinner than normal rifles are.

 wonderbow:0 "(2) Wonderbow"
 wonderbowDESCR:0 "Wonderbows are larger than Largebows and instead have mechanical mechanisms that make it easier for Scurians to load and fire the Wonderbow. The impact force of a bolt fired from a Wonderbow is enough to tear down most wooden walls."
 ironlog_cannon:0 "(5) Ironlog Cannon"
 ironlog_cannonDESCR:0 "By taking the log of an Ironwood tree and hollowing out the center, Scurians have been able to make cannons. While more prone to explode and heavier to move around than their Aveian cousins, these cannons are decently reliable."
 steellog_cannon:0 "(9) Steellog Cannon"
