 desc_yhenil_bridge:0 "The Yhenil Bridge provides passage over the 25 mile wide mouth of the Anillelerien River. It is constructed with massive stone archways that support houses, shops, and industries alike. Four large wooden drawbridges allow sailing ships to pass through the bridge. Each side is guarded by massive stone gates protecting the entrances to the city. The centerpiece is the Elisilon Palace, which sits atop the middle of the north-side bridge and gazes out upon the ocean. It has given desperately needed breathing room for the rapidly expanding trade hub, however, further widening of the bridge may be necessary."
