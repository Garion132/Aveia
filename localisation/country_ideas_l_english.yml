 LUM_idea_5:0 "The Grand Exchequer"
 LUM_idea_5_desc:0 "The Grand Exchequer is a market of companies, where stocks, shares and bonds in companies, guilds, and endeavours can be bought or sold. In other words, an early stock market. By distributing resources and opening the market, we can fine-tune the economy to behave in certain ways, such as reducing inflation and allowing for investment to take a share of the burden in development costs."
 LUM_idea_6:0 "Intelligent Urban Design"
 LUM_idea_6_desc:0 "Lumia sees cities as an opportunity to express creativity with the land as a canvas, and thus urban areas are developed with a personal touch and with the population's behavior in mind, instead of being allowed to sprawl. While this structured approach takes longer in planning, it ultimately pays off."
