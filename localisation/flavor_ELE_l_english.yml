 elesilon_flavor.1.t: "The First Professional Army"
 elesilon_flavor.1.d: "In the early days of Elesilon, a decision was made to use the vast funds of the treasury to establish a full-time guard. Those who served lived, breathed, and died as a guard. This provided the foundations for the later establishment of a professional military, one where the equipment is provided for by the coin of the state.\n\nWhile such a program is expensive, it has paid its dividends. Many of the world's military innovations have occured in Elesilon in the past simply because our captains and generals have sought to make such a system as efficient as possible. With its expense, it is difficult to replicate, so Elesilon manages to stay far ahead of those who might eye the city of the world's desire."

 elesilon_flavor.3.t: "Restructuring the Military"
 elesilon_flavor.3.d: "The time has come to take a hard look at the state of the military. There are three different schools of thought.\n\nThe Traditionalists want a return to the older traditions of the past, before the calamity, when our military fought off foes numerous times its own size. They argue that the old practices that worked need not be changed, but rather to get rid of much of the newer bloat that is dragging down our military's performance.\n\nThe Modernists want to fully embrace some of the more radical ideas produced in the time of the calamity of a strictly regimented force, however throwing away some of the older traditions.\n\nThe last school of thought is the Heterodox, who wish to rid ourselves of the professional military entirely and instead rely upon mercenary forces. However, they wish to not throw it all away, but rather insist that these mercenary companies adopt Elesilon's training regimen and high standards.\n\nWhich school of thought ought we follow?"
