 FRY_mission_2_title: "Growing A Respectable Military"
 FRY_mission_2_desc: "Respectability isn't something we care about here, we are perfectly happy being ourselves and screw the rest of the cradle. But in order to screw the rest of the cradle, we need a far more robust military."
 FRY_mission_6_title: "Army Leadership Party-Bus"
 FRY_mission_6_desc: "Our army needs leadership. Now, normal people would call on the nobility, but we prefer a different aproach. We have sent heralds across the realm, to seek out tactical genius. If you've trained crows to attack your enemies, or have had a mild disagreement that has ended in a siege, we are approaching your location."
 FRY_mission_11_title: "Formalised Training Routines"
 FRY_mission_11_desc: "Our new army needs a formal way of training troops, so we can take average people, scream at them, make them do PT until they puke, burst into their squad bay at 4 am and throw a trash can across the place before smoking the living catpiss out of them, and thereby turn them into soldiers of consistent quality."
 FRY_mission_16_title: "Acquire Weapons"
 FRY_mission_16_desc: "We're in a place, and what we need (besides a miracle) is guns. Lots of guns. We require more equipment to arm our growing military, and we need it quickly because we've got privates who are wandering around with kitchen knives tied to sticks."
 FRY_mission_20_title: "Formalise The Rank Structure"
 FRY_mission_20_desc: "What our army and navy really need, is a structure of ranks, and a chain of command. We can't keep on with the 'defer to the person with the biggest hat' rule, because last week a private bought a really big and snazzy hat, and ursurped control of the whole military for about 2 hours before someone took it off him."
 FRY_mission_23_title: "Letting Everyone Serve"
 FRY_mission_23_desc: "Seems obvious that excluding 50% of the population on the grounds of 'wrong genitals' is a great way to kneecap yourself in the recruitment department. Granted it's an old rule, but like all old rules it was likely come up with by an aristocratic husk who sucked his own pox pustules for nourishment."
 FRY_mission_26_title: "The New Military"
 FRY_mission_26_desc: "Now we have completed our military reforms, others are starting to say that we have a 'proper' military. Now, we can't call it that, because calling things 'proper' makes it sound like we've all got sticks up our asses. We'll just call it the 'new' military. That works."

 FRY_mission_32_title: "Smack The Fauns"
 FRY_mission_32_desc: "Breaking news, a bunch of runaway Faun slaves have joined a group of natives in making a state in the bluegroves, and are now thinking of raiding us. They must not have heard the decree on non-elven races. Return this lost property to it's chains, and remind them of their place in life. "
 FRY_mission_7_title: "Laying Down Keels"
 FRY_mission_7_desc: "We have exactly 3 (three) ships in our navy, the ones we came here on, and that just isn't going to cut it. We have trade we need to protect. We have coasts to defend. We direly need more boats, and that mean we need to lay down keels as fast as we can."
 FRY_mission_12_title: "Purpose Built Shipyards"
 FRY_mission_12_desc: "Instead of building our ships on, and I quote, 'the patch of beach Bill's cousin owns', the fashionable thing to do nowadays is to have purpose made areas in which we can build ships. Make some of those."
 FRY_mission_17_title: "Building Bigger Ships"
 FRY_mission_17_desc: "Now we are no longer constrained by how much weight wet sand can support, we're free to build bigger and better ships to do out bidding on the sea. "
 FRY_mission_27_title: "Get Ready To Rumble"
 FRY_mission_27_desc: "We have recently spent a lot of time and money establishing a firm military force, and now it's time to take it for a test drive. We have 3 states sitting in our way, and we are fast approaching the end of the era of colonization and the beginning of the era of conquest."
 FRY_mission_29_title: "Smack Villou"
 FRY_mission_29_desc: "Villou has long sat on our south like a particularly agressive haemorrhoid, and worse still, it's been colonizing on it's own, taking land that's very obviously ours. We have a solution for this, and the solution is smacking them very hard and taking their land."
 FRY_mission_30_title: "Smack Swania"
 FRY_mission_30_desc: "If Villou is a haemorrhoid, then Swania is a cancerous wart sitting right on our fine nation's hoo-hah. They're stuck up, overly enamoured with becoming a -thyr, and what's even worse, they don't even party. These elves are guilty of being un-hip squares, and the sentence is death. Sort them out!"

 FRY_mission_3_title: "Acquiring Wealth"
 FRY_mission_3_desc: "In order to be 'living the dream', we need to have silver, and lots of it. We should make a conscious effort to make as much money as is possible."
 FRY_mission_34_title: "Throw The Greatest Party Of All"
 FRY_mission_34_desc: "Alright, we got the stuff? All the stuff? Ok then. I think it's time we blow this scene, get everybody and the stuff together. Okay, three, two, one, let's jam"
 FRY_mission_8_title: "Acquiring Plants"
 FRY_mission_8_desc: "Nothing sells quite as well as weird plants that the fancy types can either smoke or boil and drink the juices off, and we have an entire jungle filled with weird and wonderful creeps of nature."
 FRY_mission_13_title: "Acquiring... Woah What Is This Stuff?"
 FRY_mission_13_desc: "News from the jungle has come in, and boy is it weird. Not only has the botanical society sent back many samples earmarked as possible cash-crops, they've sent back several plants that have unique effects on the psychological behaviour of living beings. These require further testing."
 FRY_mission_21_title: "The Duke Is Dead"
 FRY_mission_21_desc: "Looks Like Vilder Freyer has, ahem, yee'd his last haw. Some are saying he yee'd that haw all over a Faun slave girl's face and neck, but that's not important. What is important is that he died how he lived: like a total psychopath! Godspeed you magnificent bastard!"
 FRY_mission_24_title: "Long Live The Dutchess (I Guess)"
 FRY_mission_24_desc: "Well, here we are. You've been taught by the toughest street fighters and the most crooked merchants this nation can offer. You can cook books like a pro, you can lie with the earnestness of a hooker, and you can deliver a punch like a battering ram. And now your dad's gone, it's all you. Knock 'em dead, kid,"

 # Fry Mission 4
 #---------------------------------------------------------

 FRY_mission_4_title: "The Education Of The Heir"
 FRY_mission_4_desc: "We're throwing out the book with this one. Forget courtly education, we want an heir who looks forward as isn't afraid to get their hands dirty. This will require some improvisation, and a lot of thinking ouside of the box."
 FRY_mission_33_title: "Expand Out The Palace Economy"
 FRY_mission_33_desc: "The colonial bursary model has demonstrated that you can have separate offices of the government and still retain a form of control over them, giving you the ability to divide the task of ruling between those most suited for it. This has the interesting side effect of stopping departments from forming backroom deals."
 FRY_mission_9_title: "Military Education"
 FRY_mission_9_desc: "Yes, she's 13. But that doesn't mean she can't learn to fight. Now, conventionally, this would involve long lessons about military strategy and history, but we've decided to go in a different direction: we've entered her in an underground fight club that meets weekly in the backroom of Tailinor's Bar and Cabana. She'll learn quick!"
 FRY_mission_14_title: "Diplomatic Education"
 FRY_mission_14_desc: "Alright, now it's time to show her the art of the deal. We've apprenticed her to a local merchant, and he's going to show her how to cheat, swindle, and cajoule in the name of profit. She'll be taking the money and running with the best of them in no time!"
 FRY_mission_18_title: "The Model Heir"
 FRY_mission_18_desc: "Welp, she managed to survive all that, and has definitely come out stronger and stranger. This small child has been strategically abused just enough to be born again hard! Now we just need to wait for that old perv Vilder to pop his clogs and we can see what she's really made of!"
 FRY_mission_28_title: "The New Civil Service"
 FRY_mission_28_desc: "A new nation is going to need a new breed of courtier, one that is less obsessed with titles and prestige and more obsessed with efficiency and paperwork. We must seek out the people who will be the foundations of our new civil service."
 FRY_mission_31_title: "Promote Merchant Scribes"
 FRY_mission_31_desc: "Our new government needs people who can read, and we can recruit a lot of them from the merchants. Sure, there's also the clergy and the nobility, but they have their own agendas, and the only agenda the merchants have is the same as ours: stacking fat paper to the ceiling."

 # Fry Mission 5
 #---------------------------------------------------------

 FRY_mission_5_title: "Enlarging The Land"
 FRY_mission_5_desc: "With all this empty land around us, we have the opportunity to become beeg. That's right, beeg. Positively larj, even. A real chonker of a nation. But there's bad news and weird news: Kafethyr are thinking of sending their own in the north, and they're exclusively sending asshats. We need to beat the douchebags to the punch."
 FRY_mission_10_title: "Taming The Rainforest"
 FRY_mission_10_desc: "Pressing inland is a struggle, because there's all this dense jungle here. What we need is manpower, and axes. A lot of axes. If we put our pointy little heads together and do enough drugs, I'm sure we can come up with a solution."
 FRY_mission_15_title: "Policy Of Expansion"
 FRY_mission_15_desc: "Our colonizing effort lacks management. It needs a central administration. A building for it to go in, beurocrats to shuffle all the paper around, management to embezzle money, and a director that makes it look like it's working long enough to secure higher political office. The whole nine yards."
 FRY_mission_19_title: "Form A Colonial Bursary"
 FRY_mission_19_desc: "Colonies need funding too. We can take some of our tax moneys and trade income, and through the power of creative accounting and legitimate business, we use that make colonial maintainance cheaper and more efficient."
 FRY_mission_22_title: "At All Costs"
 FRY_mission_22_desc: "It's time to really accelerate the process. We are going to cut corners like it's crunch time at the circle factory, and we are going to get really creative with the definitions of 'colony' and 'self sustaining'. You see that outhouse over there? That counts as a colony. All that matters is the army will show up if you try to take it."
 FRY_mission_25_title: "The Expansion Machine"
 FRY_mission_25_desc: "Congratulations to all! Through various less than polite means including bribery, extortion, prostitution, violation of diplomatic norms, and money laundering, we have created a well-oiled machine that takes empty land and turns it into land that is ours. I'm proud of us."
