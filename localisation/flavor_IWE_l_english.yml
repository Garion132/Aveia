 iwenlumy.1.t:0 "A Most Rowdy Duchy"
 iwenlumy.1.d:0 "Recently, rumors have been spreading about how our most powerful duchy, Iwenlumy, guardian of Asemont, is seeking independence. Whilst such rumors would normally be laughable, dismissed as commoner rabble, these rumors are indeed being confirmed by some of the most powerful merchants in the Cradle. Thus, we ought to take them seriously, for losing Iwenlumy would cripple our kingdom and our prestige.\n\nThe old city of Nennli in the borderlands between the old heart of Kyath and Iwenlumy has long been a site of contention between the two crowns. It has been under the management of Iwenlumy since the compromise under Aldarri the Peaceable who managed some hundred years ago to keep Iwenlumy as a vassal state in the infancy of Kyathi rule. We could claim it, though killing the agreement may upset our other vassals as well, and will certainly upset Iwenlumy.\n\nAlternatively, we could call it out for what it is, high treason, and threaten anyone in the duchy with death by hanging, though that may not transpire well as there is no solid evidence nor suspects.\n\nLastly, we could just make vague threats towards the nobility in the duchy."

 iwenlumy.2.d:0 "The ruler of Kyath has, for some arbitrary reason, broken the hundred year long compromise between King Aldarri the Peaceable and Duchess Cellia and is now demanding that we hand over the city of Nennli.
