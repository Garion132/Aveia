    Pops in a province earn money from working as Farmers, RGOs, or in Buildings
        Farmers produce Food. Pops which cannot get jobs elsewhere will become Farmers
        RGOs will produce 1.8 of the good in their province (and an additional 0.2 will become available on the trade map).
            If it is a 'Food' good, then the good gets converted over to be sold as food

    They either can be Lower, Working, or Middle. If pops earn more money than they spend, then, after enough time, Lower will upgrade to Working. Working to Middle.
    Number of Middle Class pops is determined by productivity of buildings in the state. If a building has a productivity > 1 then province will begin to generate Middle Class Pops

    Building owners are Upper Class. The excess money that they get from buildings will go to building & expanding buildings. The money gets pooled in a provincial 'wealth' pool that can
    be raided/pillaged if the province is occupied.
