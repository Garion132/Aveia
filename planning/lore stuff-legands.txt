#the coming of Hyreno
A great sea beast did upon the civilised race fell, rending lumbering ships and laying the coastline of mallitors low. Then from the elves and dunnir and ulguks did a great cry erupt and that cry did stir the gods above. 
And it was decided that the most powerful of the gods, the brothers Tlaulunore and Gualorhei, would do battle upon the beast
Apon the divine brothers did Hyreno breath a great flame, and that flame did burn alike the heat of the sun. 
however the brothers then did rase their hands, Tlaulunore did then summon a wave of sand and Gualorhei did summon a wave of water. the two great waves did crash down upon the beast quenching the burning flame. And Hyreno did then stumble back in fear as the brothers undid his great attack. For then the great god Tlaulunore struck the Beastly Hyreno seven times, and seven times did the great monster howl in pain. thrice then did Gualorhei ... and then the brothers did seal the great hyreno deep into the glass, never to threaten the civilised coasts again.
