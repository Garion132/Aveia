#the coming of Hyreno
The beast Hyreno did upon the civilised races fall, rending ships and laying the coastline of the great Mallitors low. Then from the elves and dunnir and ulguks did a great cry erupt and that cry did stir the gods above. 
And it was decided that the most powerful of the gods, the brothers Tlaulunore and Gualorhei, would do battle upon the beast
Apon the divine brothers did Hyreno breath a great flame, and that flame did burn alike the very heat of the sun. 
however the brothers then did rase their hands, Tlaulunore summoned a great wave of sand and Gualorhei did then summon a wave of water. the two great waves did crash down upon the beast quenching the burning flame. And Hyreno did then stumble back in fear as the brothers undid his great attack. For then the great god Tlaulunore struck the Beastly Hyreno seven times, and seven times did the great monster howl in pain. thrice then did Gualorhei ... the fisherwomen who had hid in a cave on the island pierced her fishing knife into Hyrenos eye, blinding the great beast and covering her in a deluge of ichor. Taking advantage of this mortal wound, the brothers did seal the great hyreno deep into the glass, never to threaten the civilised coasts again.


And the great Valador did cower the other Dragon-kings and force them into submittion before him, rasing himself onto godhood and declaring himself Raktheron, Emperor of all dragons and Dragon-God of Dragon-Gods
