Pops work as follows:

Development:
    Base Tax - Middle Class
    Base Production - Working Class
    Base Manpower - Lower Class

Provincial Wealth # AKA Development. Provides bonus tax income & goods output
Provincial Capital # Money stored in province that can be used for improvements


POPULATION OVERVIEW:
    In order to provide a more controlled end-game income scheme, I've remade how development works. Instead of the old system where you had 
    base tax, base production, and base manpower, there are now three population types: Middle Class (Base Tax), Working Class 
    (Base Production), and Lower Class (Base Manpower).

    #Classes
    The Middle Class population are your artisans, clerks, merchants, artists, officers, mechanics, shopkeepers, engineers, doctors, and so on.
    Essentially, the individuals with excess income to spend on non-essentials and occasional luxuries. So, they give the largest amount of tax 
    income and edges out with the most goods production. They are often literate and politically active lending to an unruly reform-friendly 
    population. They are represented through base-tax because base-tax provides a  base of 1 yearly tax income which can only be removed by 
    adding a negative yearly income tax modifier thus making a very strange tooltip.

    The Working Class population are generally your craftsmen, factory workers, laborers, and yeomen farmers. They are the people who didn't 
    have the excess incomes of the Middle Class but were well off enough to alleviate the worst of the suffering and stay fed. This means that
    they provide the most manpower of the three categories, while also providing much more tax and goods production than the lower class. 
    This population generally desires to be literate if possible but are otherwise inert.

    The Lower Class population include slaves, serfs, peasants, and the urban poor. This population either had to work day-to-day or simply 
    had no soveriegnty. They provide decent amounts of manpower but contribute little in terms of tax income or goods production. This 
    population generally has no interest in becoming literate as their work requires no literacy and, combined with a lack of interest in 
    politics outside of the price of food, wields little political power.

    Each development represents 5k people.
    There will also be provincial modifiers for provinces with minor populations of middle/working/lower class for 1k, 2k, 3k, and 4k each.

    #Capacities
    There are capacities for each the Middle, Working, and Lower classes. When populations exceed this capacity, their growth gets 
    significantly reduced and the local population may seek to migrate to other provinces. Capacities can be increased by buildings.

    #Arable Land, Agricultural Efficiency, & Food
    In each province, there is a set amount of 'arable land' that the province has. This determines its basic capacity. Each unit of 
    arable land can sustain a certain number of 'farmers' (through capacities). Arable Land will only produce food if there are 
    farmers (Lower class pops) to fulfill that role. If there happens to be 8 arable land in a province, then that province will have 
    a base of 8 Lower Class Pop Capacity. If the population is in excess of its lower class capacity, then additional food will be grown 
    (though with diminishing returns).

    Arable Land can be set manually in each province. However, if it is not set manually, then the system will set it automatically
    based upon terrain:
        base - 0.5
        glacier - 2.5
        farmland - 9
        forest - 4
        hills - 5
        woods - 6
        mountain - 2.5
        grasslands - 7.5

        marsh - 1.5
        desert - 1.5
        coastal_desert - 3.5
        coastline - 4
        drylands - 4.5
        highlands - 4.5
        savannah - 4
        steppe - 4.5
        deepwoods - 3.5
        deepwoods_city - 7.5
        glassy_plains - 0.5
        vitaite_hills - 2
        redmarsh - 3.5
        great_bridge - 3
        great_mountain_pass - 3

    Agricultural Efficiency decreases the capacity that arable land provides & requires while increasing the food output, allowing 
    for a wealthier province with less population required to grow its crops.

    Lower Class pops under their capacity will provide food. If a country has a food surplus (where food production & imports - exports > food consumption) 
    then population will grow. If a country has a food deficit, then populations will stagnate or (at high enough deficits) decline.

    # Food Trade
    You may trade for food. Exporting food will provide tax income while importing food will reduce tax income.
    
    For this, there are four different trade policies you can enact: Trade Embargo, Export Focus, Balanced Trade, Import Focus
        Trade Embargo - No trade occurs. Your food balance depends wholly upon your own ability to grow food.
        Export Focus - Balance is set to -10%. Your population will stagnate (only Lower Class pops grow at a base of 1% per year).
        Balanced Trade - Balance is set to 0%. All sections of your population will grow at the normal rate.
        Import Focus - Balance is set to +10%. Your population will grow at double the normal rate.
    
    Export Focus is good for when you are lacking in funds and so either need to import less (if you are a large food
    importer) or export more. However, it is detrimental to do over long stretches of time.
    Balanced Trade is the default and provides a good middle ground between money & growth.
    Import focus is good for when you want to grow your population rapidly (Especially after the IAC)

    #Adding or Removing Population
    To add or remove population, use the change_population scripted effect
    change_population = { middle = 1 working = 1 lower = 1 }

    if you want to remove population, use negative values
    remove_population = { middle = =1 working = -1 lower = -1 }
    
    For the technical details, add_population will add the respective development types while updating the province values.
    Doing it through the normal add_base_tax/add_base_production/add_base_manpower will have the same end effect, but it will
    not update the tooltip values to reflect changes. 

    If you want to add/remove population as a pure number you can do that as well with the same effects.
    NOTE: total_pop is added FIRST and is added to each category weighted by their relative population
    add_population = { total_pop = 2.0 middle_pop = -1.2 working_pop = 1.4 lower_pop = 1.1 }

    You can also scale population. Basically each value gets multiplied by these. The multiplication compounds, so 
    in this case middle_pop gets multiplied by 1.2*1.2 = 1.44.
    NOTE: total_pop is scaled FIRST
    scale_population = { total_pop = 1.2 middle_pop = 1.2 working_pop = 1.4 lower_pop = 1.1 }
